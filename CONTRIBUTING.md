Thanks for looking here! We'd love your help. The micro:bit project is only
possible through contributions of companies and individuals around the world.

This project is managed on GitHub, and the best way to contribute is to jump in
and fix/file issues.

Unlike some others, this isn't a project where we expect much by way of
external interest, so get in touch with @microbit-matt-hillsdon to discuss
your ideas.
